HDFS
It is a Java-based file system providing data storage solutions. Also, it can be referred to as reliable and scalable as with HDFS the storage and computing can be distributed among many machines thereby allowing the data to grow linearly and economicaly.

Hadoop cluster
Specifically designed for storage and analysis of huge amounts of data. This special cluster works in a distributed computing environment.

HDFS Blocks
The HDFS breaks the files to a set of blocks and stores in slave nodes of the Hadoop cluster.
The blocks are all evenly sized.
- Every data block haas its own metadata and is tracked by a central server.
- High throughput , the processing of these data blocks parallely and quickly.
